Hi Tyler!

Sorry I forgot to add my databases, I realized I had done so about 15 minutes after I left Epicodus. I had intended to fix it today after work because I figured you wouldn't start reviewing code until at least Sunday but you're pretty ahead of the game this week!

Anyway, it's pretty base bones in terms of functionality but I think it's a fair expression of what I'm capable of completing with eight and a half hour's work.

Hope you're having a nice weekend,

Brendan
